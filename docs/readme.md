## Prerequisites

Before you can use the ngX -Rocket CLI, you need to have Node.js 6.9.0 and npm 3.0.0 or higher installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system on Node’ official site.

If you already have Node.js and npm installed, verify their versions by running:

       $ node -v # => displays node version
       $ npm -v # => displays npm version
  Once you have Node.js installed, you can use the npm command to install
  
  TypeScript:
  
       $ npm install -g typescript
      
You don’t technically need TypeScript, but it’s highly recommended by the Angular team, so I recommend you install it to make working with Angular as comfortable as possible.

Now that you have Node.js and TypeScript installed, you can install the ngX-Rocket CLI by running:
       $ npm i -g generator-ngx-rocket
           
This will install the ngX-Rocket generator globally on your system. You can verify the installation by using the following command:

       $ ngx version # => displays ngx-rocket version
